#### Address Spaces
- Linear array of bytes
- Physical Address Space: Collection of physical memory addresses supported by the hardware
    - From address 0 to addres MAXsys
    - Refers to location in memory unit
- Logical/Virtual Address Space: Collection of addresses that the process can access (this is the process's view)
    - From address 0 to address MAXsys
    - Address generated by CPU during execution 
    - User deals with only logical/virtual address
    - Undergoes translation by the MMU -> the output of this process is the appropriate physical address or the location of code/data in RAM (or error such as seg fault)
    - Where is this stores???
        - Virtual memory is not stored in secondary storage (RAM)
- Segment: A chunk of physical memory assigned to a process
    - Part of physical address assigned to the virtual address space

#### Address Generation
- Uniprogramming
    - One process executes at a time
    - Process is always loaded starting at 0
    - Process executes in a contiguous section of memory (process memories allocated next to each other)
    - OS gets fixed part of memory
    - Compiler can generate physical addresses
    - Maximum address = Memory Size - OS Size
    - OS is protected from processes by checking
